# G-Bay 1000


I have chosen to create an app that caters for buyers and sellers of used acoustic guitars below $1000. The target audience will be musicians with a beginner to intermediate level. Most people choose to learn on an acoustic guitar so that is what the site will be focusing on.

## Problem

There are currently some online marketplaces for instruments. Users are able to buy and sell new and used guitars as well as other items. However there is not one that is solely dedicated to guitars. This can make it difficult for people looking to buy and sell lower range acoustic guitars to find an appropriate medium for exchange. Often a guitarist will want to buy a guitar to learn on, then sell it once they are at a certain level to upgrade to a better one. The second guitar is often just under the $1000 mark for a second hand solid top.

## Solution

Sellers will provide technical specifications for all the guitars on the marketplace. This is a must so the buyer can make a decision based on their own research of the product. As well certain things will be explained in laymanâ€™s terms for the buyer: Who would usually use this kind of guitar  (absolute beginner, beginner, intermediate), \what kind of music is usually played on this type of guitar - Folk, blues, etc. This way people with little knowledge of the instruments are able to ascertain if the products suit their needs. 

Users will login using their email and a password. From there they will be able to either browse to buy or post a product on the site to sell. For every purchase, both the buyer and seller will receive an email confirmation of the sale. Guitars will be sorted into 3 categories: classical, steel string and slide. This will make it easier for the user to find the specific products that they are interested in. The app will be both a marketplace and an informative experience for the user.
